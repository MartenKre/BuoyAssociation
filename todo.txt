- write script that runs model on sample image & draws bounding boxes
- extract location of bounding boxes
- rotate image based on roll (& maybe pitch?) of camera
- Get angle between principal ray of ship and buoy (from pixel space)
- With angle and dist information transform buoy from camera cs to global cs
- perform matching
- filter matching results e.g. based on conf and/or dist to matched gt buoy

Additional tasks:
- add object tracking
- add robustness to model detection by creating more training data
