- write script that runs model on sample image & draws bounding boxes			✓
- extract location of bounding boxes							✓
- rotate image based on roll (& maybe pitch?) of camera					✓
- Get angle between principal ray of ship and buoy (from pixel space)			✓
- With angle and dist information transform buoy from camera cs to global cs		✓
- perform matching 									✓
- filter matching results e.g. based on conf and/or dist to matched gt buoy 		✓

Additional tasks:
- add object tracking 									✓
- add robustness to model detection by creating more training data 
- Online Computation of Camera Intrinsics by Cost Minimalization of Angle Deviation	✓
- Develop concept of how to deal with incorrect buoy GT data
